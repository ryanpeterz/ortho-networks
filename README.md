# ortho-networks

Included here is an ortho_module which allows a user to train a matrix 
in Tensorflow under the constraint of orthogonality. It is not very 
pretty because the intended purpose of the code was not release, but 
investigation of a phenomenon. It was nonetheless useful to me to 
isolate some of the logic for the parametrization into a module.
